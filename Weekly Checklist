Week 2 Review 
Bruce was assisting Andre in designing the chassis, so Kelvin typed up checklist and review
Sophie wasnâ€™t here on Tuesday due to illness ( informed all members prior ) 
Hayden finished the camera code, and the wheels going forward
Kelvin and Hayden briefly tested the camera code and forward moving code (not on chasis) 
Bruce and Andre made a basic chassis in order for test runs without the design needing to be complete.
On friday Hayden and Sophie got the code running remotely from a lab computer, and got the base chassis running on the line with general success.

Week 3 Checklist
goal for this week is to get through quad 2, take the swivel line better.
get some hardware designed and printed,(new plans for making the prototype better for the final test.)
Finish and submit progress report. (Due 22nd may midnight)

Week 3 Review:
tested and tweaked camera so it could take the line better.
hardware failed as we were missing people and also couldnt meet up on friday due to tutorials taken priority. (need to arrange new time and day to meet)
prototype is working well and has allowed the coders and testers to trial what they have done, also has let the boys doing the chassis more time to learn freecad.

Week 4 checklist:
Hayden/Sophie: getting code to do majority of quad 3, allowing the robot to make turns and decisions based on the intersections.
Kelvin: test and review code, following up with hayden and sophie for changes if need be.
Andre/Eevin: Design a plan of new chassis and print and draw up designs that could hold battery and sensors for quad 4.
Bruce: arrange a new meeting time, (not friday) and assist with all so goals can be reached. planning and designing new parts for hardware boys.
High priority: Getting Freecad under control and getting parts printed.
